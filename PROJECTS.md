## Projects

### mfg-farm
**Goal**: Build a fully automated manufacturing business centered on 3D printing, with a path to a full print farm. Sell products on Etsy, Amazon, and similar platforms. Develop a complete business plan: product selection driven by market demand and unique value proposition, pricing strategy, fulfillment workflow, and a scaling roadmap from single printer to multi-printer farm with multiple colors and material capabilities. Explore adjacent manufacturing (laser cutting, CNC, resin printing) and integrate where demand justifies it. The north star is maximizing income — product and machine decisions should be driven by data: what sells, what margins look like, and where automation creates the highest leverage.
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Active — ready to prototype
**Visibility**: Private — local only, no GitHub push
**Working dir**: `projects/mfg-farm/`
**Current focus**: Session 291: **Business plan COMPLETE** (`business-plan.md`). **CadQuery parametric designs COMPLETE** (`cadquery/modrun_rail.py`, `cadquery/modrun_clip.py`). Market research + competitive analysis were already complete (`market-research.md`). Etsy and Amazon listing copy already complete (`etsy-listing-modrun.md`). **Lead product: ModRun cable management system** — original design, Etsy-compliant, 65–72% net margins. **BLOCKING GATE: test print required.** User needs to: (1) run `pip install cadquery` in mfg-farm env or system Python, (2) run `python modrun_clip.py --output-dir ./stl/` and `python modrun_rail.py --output-dir ./stl/` to generate STL files, (3) test print and tune tolerance parameters, (4) photograph finished set, (5) list on Etsy. All copy, pricing, tags, photo brief are ready in `etsy-listing-modrun.md`.
**Blocked on**: Test print (user action required — see focus above)
**Notes**: Automation is the core constraint — products and workflows must be designed for minimal human touchpoints per unit. Physical products mean real fulfillment costs (packaging, shipping, storage) — factor these in from the start. Etsy and Amazon have different fee structures and audiences; may want both. Scaling from 1→N printers requires thinking about file management, queue management, quality control, and packaging throughput — not just the printers themselves.

### resistance-research
**Goal**: Identify solutions to a failing democracy — if the current government could be replaced and rebuilt from a clean slate, what would it look like? How could it be structured to ensure justice, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all citizens? How could it be objectively efficient, equitable, and functional? This project addresses the full scope of government: voting systems, taxation, education, infrastructure, healthcare, law enforcement, housing, and everything in between. The government exists to serve its citizens — so how do we actually achieve that? A secondary goal is tracking and understanding the specific crises the United States is currently facing, finding actionable responses, and building a comprehensive integrated proposal for democratic renewal.
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Active
**Visibility**: Private — local only, no GitHub push
**Working dir**: `projects/resistance-research/`
**Current focus**: Session 313: **April 18 monitoring brief COMPLETE** (`monitoring/2026-04-18-results.md`). White House ballroom Branch A confirmed — Leon acted April 16, split order (above-ground halted, below-ground permitted), stayed own order ~1 week to April 23-24, admin appealed to D.C. Circuit. No SCOTUS filing confirmed. Abrego Garcia: DOJ brief due April 20, Xinis hearing April 28 on schedule. Section 122 / CIT: deliberating. Nashville/Crenshaw: silent. **Op-ed draft COMPLETE** (`publications/op-ed-healthcare-june2026-deadline.md`, ~918 words) — "Six Weeks to Save Five Million People's Health Insurance" targeting Vox/Atlantic, April 22 submission. **Next**: April 20 monitoring pass — CAPE Phase 1 launch, DOJ Abrego Garcia brief, ballroom SCOTUS watch window (~April 23-24 stay expiry).
**Blocked on**: —
**Notes**: Ongoing research and monitoring project. Existing files cover ICE detention, litigation tracking, case studies, civic action. When no specific task is queued, extend existing threads, find new angles, and monitor developments. Democratic renewal proposal is comprehensive at 22 domains; remaining work is quality deepening and publication preparation.

### stockbot
**Goal**: Build a full-stack model building and automated trading platform with both a web app and iOS app integration. The platform should allow creation, backtesting, and optimization of trading models across multiple model types (stock, options, rule-based, ensemble, multi-timeframe). The end goal is fully automated live trading — but only after models are rigorously vetted and confidence is established through paper trading. Model training and optimization costs must stay under $20/month. Once a model is sufficiently validated through paper trading performance, it graduates to live trading. Profit maximization is the north star, but capital preservation and risk management are non-negotiable constraints.
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Active
**Visibility**: Private — local only, no GitHub push
**Working dir**: `projects/stockbot/`
**Current focus**: Session 316: **Paper Trading Dashboard COMPLETE** (commit `ebec447` — `/paper-trading` page: session cards, equity curve, cycle log, auto-refresh 30s). **Projected Returns COMPLETE** (commits `76a4142`, `ff2eefa` — historical signal chart + forward projection chart, options model support added, NameError fix). Works across all model types (stock, rule-based, MTF, options). Paper trading LIVE since April 14. **Next**: Monitor paper trading performance; additional web app features as requested.
**Blocked on**: —
**Notes**: Web app is in good shape. Model creation and most optimisation is operational. Paper trading has just started but has had issues — this is the current priority. iOS app is out of scope until paper trading is solid. All features must work across ALL model types (stock, options, rule-based, ensemble, MTF) — do not implement something for one type only.

### open-source-rideshare
**Goal**: Build a free, open-source alternative to Uber and Lyft that stops price-gouging both riders and drivers. The platform should be a web and mobile app that minimises deployment and maintenance costs, ideally using a model where the platform itself is non-profit or cooperative — the margin extracted by Uber/Lyft goes back to drivers and riders instead. Solve the real problems: regulatory compliance in different jurisdictions, driver and rider safety and security, insurance, payment processing, and trust. Also build a plan for bootstrapping the user and driver base — a rideshare app with no users is worthless, so growth strategy is part of the scope.
**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: Active — early stage
**Visibility**: Public — push to feature branches on GitHub freely. Hold on main push for user approval.
**Working dir**: `projects/open-source-rideshare/`
**Current focus**: Session 317: `GET /driver/me/mileage-report` COMPLETE (commit `9c807d6`) — year + optional month view; total km/miles, IRS deduction estimate ($0.70/mile), 12-month breakdown for full-year view. 3,812 tests passing. Branch: feature/rider-emergency-safety. **Next**: Continue driver features OR start new feature branch.
**Blocked on**: —
**Notes**: This is the only public project. Higher standards for documentation, test coverage, and code quality since it's community-facing. Regulatory/safety/security solutions and growth strategy are in scope alongside the technical build.

### seedwarden
**Goal**: Build a profitable Etsy store and digital brand focused on farming, homesteading, and survival-related digital products, with the ability to expand into physical small products and seed packets. The business needs a full foundation: high-quality digital products that genuinely help people, a consistent social media presence across relevant platforms, and a reputation for real value. The goal is profit and a loyal customer base — not just a store. Grow the business systematically, identify what sells, double down on winners, and build a media presence that drives traffic organically.
**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: Active
**Visibility**: Private — local only, no GitHub push
**Working dir**: `projects/seedwarden/`
**Current focus**: Session 103: **21 products, all PDFs generated, all listing copy complete.** Added Zone-by-Zone Seed Starting Calendar (1,635 lines, 82pp PDF, $7–$18) to product catalog — was missing from PDF generator and audit. Apartment Growing Complete Guide PDF now generated (146pp). Southwest region in Native Plants guide expanded (was 19 entries, target 30+; agent running). **Biggest blocker**: PDF mockup images needed for all listings — #1 conversion factor on Etsy, requires Canva or mockup generator. All content is ready; launch is blocked only on mockup images.
**Blocked on**: —
**Notes**: Etsy store exists with some products started but not yet quality to sell. Social media has plans but nothing executed. Need to fix quality before promoting. Plant images: all 120 native-plants images already downloaded and cached (verified Session 74) — "0/18" note in prior session was stale.

---

### open-repo
**Goal**: An open-source library for all things under the sun — a distributed, free, one-stop shop to find and share information that benefits all of humanity. Link to Wikipedia for general information, schematics, building plans, 3D models, recipes/instructions, services to share, and more. The core principle: no single person or organization controls any of it. Everything is distributed and open source. This is about leveling the playing field — giving all people the best chance to not only survive but thrive.
**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: Active — research phase
**Visibility**: Public — push to feature branches on GitHub freely. Hold on main push for user approval.
**Working dir**: `projects/open-repo/`
**Current focus**: Landscape research COMPLETE. Architecture notes COMPLETE. MVP protocol design COMPLETE (Session 78) — `mvp-protocol-design.md` (711 lines): 5 JSON-LD content type schemas, endorsement schema, ActivityPub federation protocol, 5-phase bootstrapping plan, MVP stack decisions (FastAPI/PostgreSQL/Meilisearch/Kubo/Next.js). Content import pipeline research COMPLETE — `content-import-openFarm.md`: OpenFarm API/schema/license documented, field mapping + sample transformation + 5-step implementation plan. Extraction script scaffolded: `scripts/import_openFarm.py` — `fetch_crops()`, `transform_crop()` (implemented), `validate_schema()`, `export_jsonl()`, `compute_cid_placeholder()`, CLI entry point. Key finding: OpenFarm live API shut down April 2025; data acquisition via self-hosted MongoDB export or Internet Archive snapshot. Next: acquire data (clone OpenFarm + mongoexport OR Internet Archive crawl), run import_openFarm.py, review output sample.
**Blocked on**: —
**Notes**: Start with landscape research before any building. The goal is ambitious — don't reinvent what already exists well. Identify the missing layer that ties it all together or fills the gaps nobody else is filling.

### off-grid-living
**Goal**: A comprehensive plan for off-grid, sustainable living. Define full plans for construction, implementation, operation, maintenance, and repair. Cover the complete operational architecture: food production, shelter, medicine, electricity generation, food preparation and storage, water, and general survival necessities. Include disaster scenarios up to and including nuclear disaster. Also cover community building, organization, and mutual support.
**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: Active — research phase
**Visibility**: Private — local only, no GitHub push
**Working dir**: `projects/off-grid-living/`
**Current focus**: **ALL 16 DOMAIN FILES NOW COMPLETE.** Session 103: `01-site-selection.md` (1,178 lines — 32-criterion parcel evaluation checklist; weighted scoring matrix; prior appropriation vs. riparian doctrine; state-by-state water/zoning/off-grid legality; regional comparison table with Mid-South/Appalachian/Pacific NW/Mountain West/Southwest detail; due diligence guide with minerals/easements/perc test/flood plain; 3-phase transition model with budget tables) and `12-security-defense.md` (1,252 lines — 13-threat probability×consequence matrix; fencing/camera/dog systems; livestock predator table 14 species; firearms loadout + storage + training; community defense protocols; 12 threat-specific response protocols; quarterly audit checklist; regional profiles; 50+ product reference list with 2026 prices). Both domains were the only ones listed as "Planned" in master-outline.md. **Document map now 100% complete.** **Next**: Quality review pass OR publish-ready formatting pass across all 16 domains.
**Blocked on**: —
**Notes**: This is a planning and research project, not a software build. Practical and actionable plans over theory. Include real costs, sourcing, and skill requirements where possible. Nuclear disaster scenario is in scope — treat it seriously.

### workout
**Goal**: Create comprehensive workout plans that blend athleticism, strength training, mobility, and calisthenics into unified programs. Produce plans for three equipment tiers: no equipment, resistance bands only, and full gym. Provide proposals for different training frequencies (days/week), exercise variety, and formats to build the best all-in-one plan maximizing strength growth while addressing athleticism, mobility, and bodyweight mastery.
**Priority**: Low
**Status**: Active
**Visibility**: Private — local only, no GitHub push
**Working dir**: `projects/workout/`
**Current focus**: `comprehensive-plan.md` (1,053 lines) complete — covers all 3 equipment tiers (no equipment, bands, full gym) × multiple frequencies (3/4/5/6 days), with full exercise libraries, progression systems, calisthenics skill ladders, and mobility protocols. Awaiting user review and selection.
**Blocked on**: —
**Notes**: Content/planning project, not a software build. Goal defined by user on 2026-04-12. Existing `proposals_v2.md` covers the 6-day gym PPL in detail (referenced from comprehensive plan). `requirements.md` has baseline info and calisthenics skill levels.
