### feat/background-checks-firebase-push — driver tipping system

**Branch:** `feature/background-checks-firebase-push`
**Author:** thorn
**Date:** 2026-04-13

**Summary:**
Adds a standalone driver tipping system. Riders can tip their driver within
48 hours of ride completion. Tips are stored as integer cents to avoid
floating-point errors. Stripe is used for payment processing when credentials
are present; the feature degrades gracefully without them.

**Files changed:**
- `backend/app/models/tip.py` — new `TipRecord` model with `TipStatus` enum
- `backend/app/schemas/tip.py` — `TipRequest` (50–5000 cents) and `TipResponse`
- `backend/app/services/tips.py` — `submit_tip`, `get_tip_for_ride`, validation, notifications
- `backend/app/api/v1/tips.py` — 4 endpoints (POST tip, GET ride tip, GET driver tips, GET admin tips)
- `backend/app/models/__init__.py` — registers `TipRecord`
- `backend/app/main.py` — includes tips router
- `backend/tests/test_tips.py` — 37 tests (18 pass without DB, 19 require PostgreSQL test DB)

**Endpoints added:**
- `POST /api/v1/rides/{ride_id}/tip` — rider submits tip
- `GET  /api/v1/rides/{ride_id}/tip` — rider or driver fetches tip
- `GET  /api/v1/drivers/me/tips` — driver tip history with pagination
- `GET  /api/v1/admin/tips` — admin list with status/driver/date filters

**Test results:** 18 passed, 19 skipped (DB-dependent integration tests skip gracefully
when `OPENRIDE_TEST_DATABASE_URL` is not available, consistent with all other test files).

**Review notes:**
- The legacy `add_tip` on `payments.py` (using float dollars) is left untouched to
  avoid breaking the existing payment flow. The new `TipRecord` is the canonical path
  going forward; a follow-up can deprecate the old field.
- Driver earnings endpoint (`GET /driver/earnings`) already aggregates `tip_amount`
  from the `Payment` model. The new `TipRecord` amounts are separate and would need
  a follow-up to roll them into earnings totals once the migration is complete.
